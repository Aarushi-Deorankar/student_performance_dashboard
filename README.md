🎓 Student Performance Dashboard | Power BI
1. Project Title / Headline

Student Performance Analytics Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize student academic performance across subjects, gender, and results, helping identify trends, strengths, and areas for improvement.

2. Short Description / Purpose

The Student Performance Dashboard is a beginner-level Power BI project that provides a clear and interactive overview of student marks, pass/fail distribution, and subject-wise performance.
It is designed to demonstrate data visualization, basic analytics, and dashboard design skills using Power BI.

3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
📊 Power BI Desktop – Primary tool used to design and build the interactive dashboard
📂 Power Query – Used for loading and basic data preparation
🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures such as average marks and student counts
📝 Data Modeling – Single-table model with proper data types and aggregations
📁 File Formats – .pbix for the Power BI report, .csv for the dataset, .png for dashboard preview

4. Data Source

Source: Manually created dataset for learning and demonstration purposes.
The dataset contains student-level academic data, including:
Student Name & ID
Subject
Mark
Gender
Attendance Percentage
Result (Pass / Fail)

The data is structured in a flat CSV format suitable for beginner-level Power BI analysis.

5. Features / Highlights
• Business Problem
Educational institutions and educators often need a simple way to understand student performance across subjects and demographics.
Raw marks alone do not easily reveal trends such as subject difficulty, pass/fail distribution, or gender-wise performance differences.

• Goal of the Dashboard
The goal of this dashboard is to:

Provide a clear overview of student performance
Enable quick comparison across subjects
Identify pass/fail patterns
Allow interactive filtering by subject and gender
Demonstrate foundational Power BI skills for resume and internship purposes

• Walkthrough of Key Visuals

Key KPIs (Top Section)
Average Marks
Total Number of Students
Gender-wise Student Distribution (Pie Chart)
Displays the proportion of male and female students
Helps identify gender distribution in the dataset

Pass vs Fail Distribution (Column Chart)
Shows the count of students who passed or failed
Useful for overall performance assessment

Average Marks by Subject (Horizontal Bar Chart)
Compares average marks across subjects such as English, Math, Science, and SST
Highlights subject-wise strengths and weaknesses

Student Performance Details (Table)
Displays individual student performance
Includes student name, subject, marks, and result
Allows detailed inspection of records

Interactive Slicers
Subject slicer
Gender slicer
These slicers dynamically filter all visuals on the dashboard.

• Business Impact & Insights

📈 Academic Monitoring: Helps teachers or analysts quickly assess overall student performance
🎯 Targeted Improvement: Identifies subjects where average scores are lower
👥 Demographic Analysis: Enables gender-based performance comparison
📊 Decision Support: Assists in data-driven academic planning and evaluation
